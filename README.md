# Introduction #
This is a development framework for PHP based web sites. It is an unmaintained academic project developed within the course of Internet Applications at Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gestão, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria.

It features an example website based on the (Portuguese) contents of Associação Fátima Cultural and is based on technologies like XHTML, PHP, Javascript, CSS and (My)SQL.

Within the code you can learn how to build a highly modularized website (using actions and/or filters), with modules/components such as TinyMCE, Google Maps, Picasa, File manager and many others.
